\chapter{Introduction}

The \mcapl{} software is a suite of tools for building interpreters
for agent programming languages and  model checking programs
executing in those interpreters.  

This manual consists primarily of basic installation instructions and then a set of tutorial covering various aspects of using the system and some of the languages shipped with it.  These tutorials can also be found in the tutorials sub-directory.

{\bf Note} This release comes packaged with Jar files for NASA's Java Pathfinder (JPF) tool and a number of other libraries.  The relevant jars, zip files of source code and the NASA license can be found in \texttt{lib/3rdparty}.  The release is configured to run using the version of JPF packaged with it, but this means that some adaptation, particularly of configuration files, may be required to run it on systems where JPF is already installed.
