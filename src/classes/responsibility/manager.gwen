//Cleaning responsibility actions
res(clean, delegate, agent1)
res(hoover, delegate, agent1)
res(observeDirt, observe, null)

//Safety responsibility actions
res(safety, delegate, manager)

//Tree nodes for responsibilities
resTree(cleaning, [clean, hoover, observeDirt])
resTree(clean, [])
resTree(hoover, [])
resTree(observeDirt, [])
